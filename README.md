Purpose: This README will describe the practical steps of how to host and format a resume using GitHub Pages

### <ins> **What is GitHub?** </ins>

GitHub is software that XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX partnered with our sister website: *GitHub Pages*

### <ins> **GitHub Pages** </ins>
*GitHub Pages* is a tool from GitHub that helps you turn your GitHub repositories into webpages for better presentation and access. *GitHub Pages* gives you the ability to showcase stylish webpages for a variety of functions such as:
* Portfolios
* Projects
* Project Documentation
* Resumes

*GitHub Pages* has the added benefit of not requiring knowledge of databases, servers or, at times, knowledge of HTML. This is all of the information we need to host our resumes on GitHub Pages.

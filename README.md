Purpose: This README will describe the practical steps of how to host and format a resume using GitHub Pages

Hosting your resume online is the first step into entering a new job market with new job opportunities in technology. GitHub is a great site to host this new resume, but before we begin the tutorial on how to host a resume, we first ask:

### <ins> **What is GitHub?** </ins>

GitHub is software that XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX partnered with our sister website: *GitHub Pages*

### <ins> **GitHub Pages** </ins>
*GitHub Pages* is a tool from GitHub that helps you turn your GitHub repositories into webpages for better presentation and access. *GitHub Pages* gives you the ability to showcase stylish webpages for a variety of functions such as:
* Portfolios
* Projects
* Project Documentation
* Resumes

*GitHub Pages* has the added benefit of not requiring knowledge of databases, servers or, at times, knowledge of HTML. This is all of the information we need to host our resumes on GitHub Pages.

* Step 1: Creating a GitHub Repository
    - Head over to [GitHub](https://github.com/), log in (or [create an account](https://github.com/signup?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home)), look to the **+** sign at the top right and click **New Repository** ![]( https://github.com/Flexyduck/flexyduck.github.io/blob/main/Gifs/new_repository.gif)

* Step 2: Clone your repository
    - If you are using GitHub Desktop, you can choose the **Set up in Desktop** ![]()option on the repository homepage from GitHub. This should redirect you to the GitHub Desktop app, when it does, save the project. If the GitHub Desktop app does not automatically redirect, manually launch it and the just clone the repository by selecting *Clone Repository* from the File option in the Menu Bar on the top of your screen
    - If your are using terminal or Command Prompt, you can clone our repository by entering `git clone https://github.com/username/username.github.io` into your terminal.
